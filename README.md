**An AI-powered Streamlit application that extracts structured invoice data from PDF files using Groq's LLaMA-3 model.**

---

## Project Overview

This application simplifies the process of reading and extracting useful information from invoices in PDF format. By leveraging **LangChain** and **Groq's LLaMA-3**, the app intelligently identifies and extracts fields like:

* Invoice number
* Description
* Quantity
* Date
* Unit price
* Amount
* Total
* Email
* Phone number
* Address

Users can upload multiple invoices, and download the extracted data as a CSV.
